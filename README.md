# Abs_text_summarization
A deep learning-based model that automatically summarises text in an abstractive way. The model leverages advances in deep learning technology and search algorithms by using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), the attention mechanism and beam search. The model was tested, validated and evaluated on a publicly available dataset regarding both real and fake news.
